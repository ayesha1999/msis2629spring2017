        Regional Universities offer a full range of undergraduate programs and
        some master's programs but few doctoral programs. Regional
        Universities include Providence College, Santa Clara University,
        Elon University and Butler University. These rankings are split into 
        four regions: <a href="/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-north">North</a>, 
        <a href="/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-south">South</a>, 
        <a href="/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-midwest">Midwest</a> and 
        <a href="/best-colleges/rankings/regional-universities-west">West</a>.
